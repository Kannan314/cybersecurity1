Networks:
      Vulnerability- weakness
      Tools:
         CyberSecurity tools:
                  hashcat- password cracking tools.
                  BruteForce
                 RAT-Remote Access Troger
cybersecurity:
    data
    resource
    safeguarding:
        Physical control
        Administration control
        Logical control
Port Scanning
protocol-set of rules
tcp and udp - connects the hardware and software and transfer the data
tcp consists of 65535 ports 
udp consists of 65535 ports
http- work in 80(it is not safe)
https - work in 443(SSL)(it is safe)
block chain
difference b/w http and https
exploit
sql injection
session hijacking
DNS 
IP address
cloud
cryptography
ARP Poisioning(Address Resolution Protocol)
spoofing
hashing
metasploid
backdoor
hacking- gaining unauthorized access.
ethical hacking-gaining unauthorized access with written permission.
web application peneteration- web page hacking
webpage, website, web application, web server
web application- interaction with user
carrier opportunities:
    (red team) offensive(attackers)
     (blue team)defensive(soc analyst)
     (purple team)- offensive and defensive
three types of hacker:
       White hat- software architecture known by attackers
       black hat- they are hackers
       gray hat- combination of white and black hat
       Script Kiddies- use the data available in internet and done it without knowing about it.
       HACKTIVIST-hacking for social causes
       state sponsered hackers- government sponsered hackers.
  BYOD-Bring Your Own Device
CIA traid:
  C-Confidentiality
  I-Integrity
  A-Availability
Authentication- to verify the identity of the people 
Authorization or Access Control- to get permission to use it.
Authentication is done by three ways:
                 something you know(knowledege factor)
                 something you have(using id cards)
                 something you are(based on characters)
above three if we use any two for authentication, then it is two factor
above three if we use all three  for authentication, then it is multi factorfd
UAC(User Access Control)-pop up message when we install software
conversion of clear text to sipher text(human un understandable form)is called encryption
Loss of control - (breach)
even - observable occurance in a network or system
exploit - A particular attack. 
incident -  the affect of CIA 
Intrusion - A security event
Threat - Potiential to damage
liklywood - occurance
Risk - Threat + vulnearablitiy
TOE - Target of Evoluation
CIDR - Classless Inter Domain Rotation
Ipv4
192.168.1.1/24 -     TOE -32bit - 0-9
Ipv6
128bit-Hex-0-9
LAN - It is connected with the one Subnet.
WAN - It is connected with more than one Subnet.
On windows path - ping 172.1.44.44
On Linux path - ping 172.1.44.44 -c 4
The option which have all the command
Same network device to be get connection - Crossover
Different device to be get connected - straight through
Two router to be get connected - SerialDTE coaxial cable
